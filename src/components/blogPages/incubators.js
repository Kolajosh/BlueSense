          Imagine you’re an early-stage start-up founder with a brilliant
          product or service that can help thousands of people solve a really
          painful problem. You’ve introduced it to the market, have a few
          customers and a business model and then you realise you have no funds
          you need to grow your business to the next level. This is where
          incubators and accelerators come in.
          <br />
          <br />
          There are about 1000 incubators and accelerator programs in the world
          providing solutions to start-ups. From the literal meaning, incubators
          nurture new ideas while accelerators improve the growth of an existing
          company. In the case of incubators, they work with founders at the
          idea stage and help you network with other entrepreneurs, build on
          your idea, determine product-market fit, and get investment-ready.
          While accelerator programs help founders — who demonstrate potential
          for rapid growth — with expert advice, training, mentoring,
          networking, and often financial support too.
          <br />
          <br />
          However, founders have complained about the low acceptance rate or how
          difficult it is to get into an accelerator program. For instance, the
          Y company based in Silicon Valley has a yearly acceptance rate of 3%.
          Although a lot of people recommend the program as it helps you achieve
          growth for your business which would normally take years within 3–6
          months.
          <br />
          <br />
          Accelerator programs have an open recruitment process, which is open
          to specific audiences, but they accept a few applicants. In
          comparison, incubator programs have an exclusive recruitment process,
          which is open to specific audiences, but they accept many.
          <br />
          <br />
          Apart from the networking and structured guidance, accelerator
          programs provide, they also provide funds to your company which can be
          used to fund research, marketing, fine-tune a product, or hire new
          team products. In return for the funds provided, they are entitled to
          an equity share in your company. This is mostly not the case with
          incubators. They do not focus on providing funds but rather on the
          development of your business.
          <br />
          <br />
          Accelerator programs also have a set graduation date or demo day for
          their members after finishing the program. This day is set aside to
          allow you as a participant to display your business and also try to
          secure investors for your business. However, incubators do not have a
          set graduation date for their members after finishing the program.
          <br />
          <br />
          Accelerators typically do not provide office space for participants,
          although they may have a physical site where conferences or shared
          resources are held, as well as for advising. Incubators, on the other
          hand, provide start-ups with specialised office space for a certain
          length of time.
          <br />
          <br />
          However, while a few accelerators and incubators have been highly
          effective in assisting businesses to achieve success, acceptance into
          a start-up accelerator or incubator programme is not a guarantee of
          success for a start-up founder.
